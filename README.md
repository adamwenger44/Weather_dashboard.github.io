# Weather_dashboard.github.io

This is a tool to search cities to look at the weather in that area.  It uses the API from OpenWeatherMap to get this information.  The user can type in a city into the search bar, then hit the button to display the information on the page, along with a icon about the weather, using a second API (also from open weather map).  If continuing to type in cities, it will keep displaying them, the most recent at the top of the page.
